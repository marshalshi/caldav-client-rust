Trying to use :code:`reqwest` crate to fetch events data from CalDav server.

1. Please create your own :code:`settings.rs` file with CalCal URL, username and password.
2. Please update start time and end time in :code:`main.rs`. I hardcoded there.

After running, code will print out the events which happen in time-range.
